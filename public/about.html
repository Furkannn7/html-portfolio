<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 20 year old college student who is interested in anime/manga and coding. Although I am aware of how much of a novice portfolio I am building, I have set out with the motto 'a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step'. And this is my first serious project!</p>
