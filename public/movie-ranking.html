<h1>The Best Movies According to Furkan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Hard to decide which one of it is my favorite. But if i have to put decide the top 1, it would be Spirited Away. Love the plot and animations.</p>
<h3>Dr Strange</h3>
<p>I like the way mysticisim handled. Very interesting and enjoyable. Main character's development is also very good.</p>
<h3>Ghost Rider</h3>
<p>This one is a little bit old. Spirited Away also old but animation movies makes a show so much loveable for me...So even with the best plot, ghost rider takes the 3rd placement.</p>
